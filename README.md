# Pokemon VGC Analyzer

### This project is in the hopes of developing a fully functional program that can:
1. Crawl Victory Road and Smogon to find top used Pokemon for the current regulation,
2. Format tables with calculated pick rates and stradegies for top used Pokemon in the current regulation,
3. Create unique teams based on the top performing Pokemon in the current regulation using AI,
4. Simulate the "most optimal game" with 2 competitive team inputs using AI
